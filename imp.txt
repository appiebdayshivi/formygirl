Dear Shivi,
    I know yeh thoda alag tareeka hai kuch bhi kehne ka but yea, ese hi keh raha kyuki pinterest pe zyada long texts jate ni
    zyada long ni likhunga but still, i hope ki tumko yeh chhoti si cheez psnd aaye and it brings a smile on your face.
    
*fingers crossed*
    
    Han toh shivi, mujhe tumko batana tha ki maine na first time tumko class 6th mein dekha tha, i mean baat waat nai ki thi and tumne bhi mujhe ni dekha tha but i can remember from 
    your smoll choti ki han, maine kahin toh dekha hai.
    Agar tumhe yaad ho toh class 6th 2nd floor ke right side wale corridor mein hai, sirf 2 sections, D aur E and 6th mein mai D mein tha aur tum E mein.
    Agal bagal but phir bhi ek doosre ko jante nai the kyuki kabhi mile hi nai the. Yahi nai pata tha mujhe ki sh_______ mi____ naam ki koi ladki bhi hai iss school mein.
    BTW maine yeh ese isliye likha kyuki mein reveal ni krna chahta tumhara name internet pe. Isiliye koi pic bhi ni lagaunga tumhari, bas text.
    Ha toh mein janta bhi nai tha ki iss name ki koi ladki exist bhi karti hai iss school mein and then came class 7th. Mumma bhut keh rahi thi ki wapas Shyam Nagar wali branch mein
    chale jao ya phir N Block wale mein chale jao kyuki unka manna tha "kam padhna padega".
    Par mein bhi ziddi thehra, maine kaha "na na bhai, mujhe toh zyada hi padhna hai" and mein aa gaya 7th-D mein.
    And pata, mostly saare sections ke jo sabse achhe dost the na, wahi sab aaye the D section mein like Anant and aryan chauhan aur vansh tiwari aur vishwajeet, tum aur sumedha
    haina, except for me, tab jo mera best friend tha Aditya Singh, usko bhej diya tha A section mein uss chhukti Nishtha ne.
    Han toh first day tha school ka, 7th ka i mean, and mein kisi ko nai janta tha except for manas, priya and pearl. But ladki ke saath thodi na baithta, kyuki meri phatti thi
    ladkiyon se baat karne mein uss time toh mein manas ke saath baith gaya, jabki woh ishan aur aryan pathak ke saath baithna chahta tha but still mere kehne pe baith gaya woh mere
    saath.
    And then, when the attendance was going on, ma'am called out your name, and that was when, i fell in love as soon as i saw you
    Woh "First Love" video mein jaise woh kehta hai na, "Kittiiiiii cute hai"
    same mera bhi reaction tha ki "Kittiiiii cute hai", and that was when i got myself a crushhhhh
    i mean, i was in love, fr
    phir jab tumhare aas paas baitha then tumse baatein start ki and dosti ho gyi, usko rishtedaari mein badalna chahta tha sch kahu toh par baat karne mein hi lajja aati hi itni ki
    kya kahu.
    Phir ek din tumne hi kaha ki chalo firefox khelte hai
    mein, tum, aryan chauhan, pearl, vishwajeet, hum sab khel rahe the, aur bhi koi tha agar toh mujhe yaad nai, and i remember ki tum last seat pe baithi thi right side and mein second 
    last seat pe baitha tha left side, 2nd row mein
    tab toh pata hi nai tha ki bhai firefox kis chidiya ka naam hai, then tumne bataya ki dil dimag aur dustbin wagera wagera sab
    toh bhai game start hua, and kisi bhale insaan ne tumko naam diye "medhansh, shivansh and me"
    and you paused for a while and said, me in dil, shivansh in dimag and medhansh in trash
    aur mere mann mein laddoo phootne lage. schhi mein, uss din meri khushi ka koi thikana ni tha.
    and then u wrote your number on my palm and i was hiding it from others all the time. ( hehe )
    but phir woh meri galti and i ruined everything but then one day, u texted me, and i apologised to u for my mistake
    and then, mera kaam complete hota tha phir bhi maangta tha tumse taki baat kar pau
    then slowly slowly we started talking on what's app. i always wanted to tell you that i loved u, sooo much, but i never got the courage to confess my love for you
    but one day, meri kismat ka pahiya ghooma and u said it
    "i like you"
    i pinched myself a couple of hundred times to check if it was happening for real, and it was real.
    It was not a dream.
    and now, i could proudly say that I HAVE A GALFREN.
        
*sighs*

    Uhm, tum soch rhi hogi, yeh sab kyu bata raha hu mein tumhe, right ?
    Shivi, i actually love you, even after so many fights and arguments, i love you
    All i want, is to keep you happy, and with me, till my last breath
    And i am not making this up, if i say that i want to live with u forever, that means i'll try my best, i'll do all i can do make it happen
    I love you shivi, bhut zyada chahta hu tumko and i can't afford to let you go, please.
    
    Patching things up a million times is better than breaking up shivi.
    I am here, ready to spend the rest of my life with u. I promise, jo gltiyan ab tak maine ki hai, i'll not do that again.
    And shivi, u are not trapped, u are free to do whatever you want, you are free to be friends with whosoever you want.
    I will never stop you from doing this and neither will i ever make u feel trapped or stuck again.
    I just love you shivi, more than i show and more that you'll ever get to know.
    And i can do anything to make u happy, and i will.
    I promise.
    Please ni jao, i need you, infact we need each other.
    I love you.
    
    
    "जो मैं तुझसे मिला, थोड़ा सबसे जुदा
        थोड़ा खुद से हुआ हूँ
        जो मैं केह ना सका, नज़रों में है लिखा
        ज़रा पढ़ के बता तू

        मैं हूँ तेरी आँखों में
        तेरी-मेरी राहों में
        एक पल भी ना हो फ़ासला

        अब देखूं ना
        आये जो अब कोई सुबाह तेरे बिना
        और चाहूँ ना
        हो सच कोई ख्वाब मेरा तेरे बिना"
        
   I love you shivi <3.
tumhara,
Bathkha.
